##HOW TO INSTALL PYTHON ON WINDOWS

Here is how I installed python on my computer. If you follow the steps below, you can successfully 
install python on your computer also. The steps are as follows:

    1. Visit www.python.org and then download the latest version. The latest version when I downloaded
    mine was python3.12.3.
    2. The next step is to click on download and then it takes you to the download page. You Can 
    choose to download the latest version or choose to download any version of your choice.
    Click on your preferred version and it will download.
    3. After the download is complete, double click on the downloaded file and an installation page 
    would come up.
    4. Click The add path checkbox so that the python path can be set automatically, then click on 
    install now. After installation is complete you will see a page saying "Setup was successful"
    5. Finally, you have to confirm if your python was successfully installed by going to “start”, 
    search and click on cmd which is your command line. Once it opens, type the command 
    “python--version” and the version of the python you installed would be displayed.
    
Hurray! You’ve successfully installed python on windows.
